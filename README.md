# 👋 Hi, I'm Amaury Mulcey

I'm a **Computer Science undergraduate student** based in La Rochelle and a **passionate full-stack developer**. Curious and motivated, I enjoy building clean, scalable, and user-friendly applications, whether for academic projects, personal ideas, or freelance missions.

I like working across the stack — from designing robust back-end architectures and APIs to crafting modern, responsive front-end interfaces. I’m always learning, experimenting, and pushing myself to grow as a developer.

* 🎓 Computer Science undergraduate student
* 💼 Freelance / Independent contractor
* 🌐 Web & Full-Stack Developer
